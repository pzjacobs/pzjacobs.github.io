I plan to use this site as a portfolio to share my work.

These blog posts serve as a way for me to ease into sharing things and also practice writing. I've spent a lot of time learning and studying different topics, but I haven't created anything to share with others. I want to help improve people's lives and prevent conflict between countries, and if information and ideas just live in my head they don't accomplish anything. This I am trying to remedy.

I first set up this GitHub Pages site 6 months ago but left it in a half-baked state. My current plan is to update the site more regularly, potentially every week.
