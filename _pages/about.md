Hi! I'm Paul Jacobs. I'm interested in conflict resolution and helping fix societal issues. I currently volunteer and do freelance work related to political depolarization, and am looking for a full-time position. Check out my resume [here](/resume.md).

My primary work experience is as a Quality Assurance Analyst for electronic health record software. The main course of that work was testing the [MyChart](https://www.mychart.org/) patient portal, with sides of internal server support, technical documentation, and project management. 

In college I worked as a GIS Research Assistant, majored in Geography and Global Studies, and minored in Political Science and Russian.
