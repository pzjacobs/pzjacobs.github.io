title: "Issues Facing the US"
---

This is an attempt to map out issues facing the US. The main goals are to:
1. Summarize issues and proposed solutions to them.
2. Find root causes of problems.
3. Present issues in a simple but informative way.
4. See the many issues we're faced by but not be overwhelmed by them.
5. yeah n all that

Things to note:
1. This is very much a work in progress.
2. There is a better way to present this, but this is what I've got for now.
3. This project definitely would benefit from the help of others, working on it solo for now though.
